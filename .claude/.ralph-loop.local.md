## Prompt

You are working on GiveSmarter, a fundraising platform.

CONTEXT:
- Read docs/status.md for workstream status
- Read docs/plan.md for architecture and goals
- Only WS-PAY is complete; all others are 'in progress'

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Run 'npm run build' and 'npm run lint' - fix any errors
2. Run 'npm run test:e2e' - fix any test failures
3. Pick ONE workstream from status.md that is 'in progress' and advance it
4. After each workstream improvement, run build/lint/tests again

RULES:
- Make small, incremental changes
- Commit after each meaningful change with descriptive messages
- Update docs/status.md when you complete a workstream feature
- Do NOT start new workstreams until current one passes all checks

COMPLETION:
Output <promise>READY FOR REVIEW</promise> when:
- Build passes with no errors
- Lint passes with no errors
- All E2E tests pass
- At least one workstream has been meaningfully advanced

If you hit a blocker you cannot solve, output <promise>BLOCKED</promise> with details.
